# Basic-Calculator

Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Project Description
I built a basic calculator for this project using HTML for the structure, CSS for the looks, and JavaScript for all the operations. My main goal was to create a working calculator that can do basic math like adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. This project helped me practice my front-end skills and understand how these web technologies work together.


Key Features
Easy to Use: I designed a simple and friendly interface. It has a display for showing numbers and results, plus buttons for all the digits (0-9), a decimal point, and math operations (+, -, *, /). I also added "Clear" and "Equals" buttons.



Math Operations: The calculator can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I made sure it follows the right order for calculations, like BODMAS/BIDMAS.



Input: You can use the buttons or your keyboard to put in numbers and operations.


Error Handling: I put in some basic error handling to catch issues like trying to divide by zero.


Extra Stuff I Added: To make it even better, I included some extra features like a square root function, percentage calculations, and memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC).

How to Use
Just open the index.html file in your web browser.

Click on the number and operation buttons to do your calculations.

Hit the "=" button to see the answer.

"C" clears everything, and "⌫" deletes the last thing you typed.

The memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC) help you store and recall numbers.

You can also type numbers and operators using your keyboard, and use Enter for equals, Backspace to delete, and Escape to clear.

Project Files
index.html: This is the main file that sets up the calculator's layout.

style.css: This file makes the calculator look good.

script.js: This is where all the calculator's brains are – it handles all the math and button clicks.

Error Handling
If something goes wrong with a calculation (like dividing by zero), the calculator will show "Error".

What I Focused On
When I was building this, I made sure:

The calculator works correctly for all basic operations.

It's easy and pleasant to use.

My code is neat and well-organized.

It handles errors smoothly.

All the extra features I added work as they should
